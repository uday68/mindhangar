## 🚀 Key Features & Implementation

### 1. Unified Spatial Workspace
**Concept:** Reduce cognitive load by eliminating tab-switching.

![Spatial Workspace Layout](https://placehold.co/800x400/f1f5f9/334155?text=Unified+Spatial+Interface&font=roboto)
*Above: The "Studio" layout. Users can drag, resize, and layer panels (Planner, Notes, Video) like a desktop operating system. This spatial arrangement allows students to watch a lecture, take notes, and check their schedule simultaneously without losing context.*

*   **Implementation:** Uses `react-rnd` for a window-manager-like experience on the web.
*   **Layouts:** Includes presets like *Studio* (Balanced), *Cinema* (Video-focused), and *Research* (Split-screen) to instantly adapt the environment to the task.

### 2. AI-Powered Planner & Roadmap Designer
**Concept:** Break down vague goals into actionable steps using AI decomposition.

![AI Curriculum Designer](https://placehold.co/800x400/f1f5f9/334155?text=AI+Generated+Roadmap&font=roboto)
*Above: The Roadmap Generator. A user inputs a goal (e.g., "Learn Machine Learning"), and the AI constructs a week-by-week curriculum complete with specific video and reading resources, tracking progress visually.*

*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Schedule:** Generates 3-day study schedules based on user goals via Gemini.
    *   **Curriculum Designer:** Creates full semester-length roadmaps (Weeks, Topics, Resources).
    *   **Tech:** Uses structured JSON generation from Gemini to render interactive timelines.

### 3. Video Studio with AI Summarization
**Concept:** Turn passive watching into active learning.

![Video Studio](https://placehold.co/800x400/f1f5f9/334155?text=Video+Player+%2B+AI+Summary&font=roboto)
*Above: The Video Panel. YouTube videos play on the left while the AI generates a "Key Insights" summary on the right. Students can copy these insights directly into their notes.*

*   **Implementation:**
    *   Embeds YouTube videos directly in the workspace.
    *   **AI Summarization:** Takes transcript text and uses LLMs to extract actionable bullet points.
    *   **Focus Guard:** Automatically warns or restricts entertainment content during active Focus Sessions.

### 4. Smart Notes (Block-Based Editor)
**Concept:** Atomic note-taking inspired by Notion.

![Block Editor](https://placehold.co/800x400/f1f5f9/334155?text=Block-Based+Note+Editor&font=roboto)
*Above: The Notes Panel. Content is structured as "blocks" (headings, todos, bullets), allowing for easy rearrangement. The editor supports slash commands and seamless organization of thoughts.*

*   **Implementation:**
    *   Data stored as granular "Blocks" in a normalized state store (`zustand`).
    *   Allows seamless mixing of text and future rich-media types.

### 5. Cognitive Training (Quiz & Flashcards)
**Concept:** **Active Recall** and **Spaced Repetition**.

![Quiz Generator](https://placehold.co/800x400/f1f5f9/334155?text=AI+Quiz+Generator&font=roboto)
*Above: The Quiz Panel. The AI generates multiple-choice questions based on a specific topic. After the quiz, the "AI Coach" provides a detailed analysis of why the user got a question wrong.*

*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Quiz Generator:** Instantly creates questions to test understanding.
    *   **Flashcards:** Generates front/back study cards with 3D flip animations.
    *   **AI Coach:** Diagnoses misconceptions and suggests recovery strategies.

### 6. Deep Focus Monitor
**Concept:** **Pomodoro Technique** + **Flow State** maintenance.

![Focus Calibration](https://placehold.co/800x400/f1f5f9/334155?text=Focus+Readiness+Test&font=roboto)
*Above: The Focus Calibration test. Before starting a deep work session, the user performs a reaction-time test to gauge alertness. The session timer then locks the UI to prevent distractions.*

*   **Implementation:**
    *   **Readiness Test:** A reaction-time game to gauge alertness.
    *   **Visual Tracking:** Optional camera integration simulates attention tracking (privacy-focused, local only).
    *   **Lock Mode:** UI restrictions during deep work to prevent opening unrelated panels.

### 7. Mobile Companion Pairing
**Concept:** Second-screen experience for distraction blocking and notifications.

![Mobile Pairing](https://placehold.co/800x400/f1f5f9/334155?text=QR+Code+Mobile+Pairing&font=roboto)
*Above: The Onboarding Scanner. Users scan a secure QR code to pair their mobile device. This connection enables the desktop app to silence phone notifications during deep focus sessions.*

*   **Implementation:**
    *   **QR Scanner:** Uses `react-qr-reader` for in-browser camera access.
    *   **Context Awareness:** Syncs "Focus State" between desktop and mobile profiles.
