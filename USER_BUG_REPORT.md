## 🎯 **Overall User Experience Feedback**

**What I Like**:
- Beautiful spatial workspace design
- AI-powered features are innovative
- Block-based notes are intuitive

**What Needs Urgent Fixing**:
1. **Language support** - This is supposed to be "AI for Bharat" but it's English-only!
2. **Offline functionality** - Doesn't work without internet
3. **Mobile optimization** - Unusable on my phone
4. **Indian education integration** - No CBSE/JEE content
5. **Data usage** - Too expensive for my data plan

**Would I Recommend to Friends?**
Not yet. The concept is great but it's not ready for Indian students. Feels like a Western app with an Indian name.

**Rating**: 3/10 (Would be 9/10 if the above issues are fixed)

**Note to Developers**: I really want to use this app! The idea is amazing. But please make it work for actual Indian students like me. We need:
- Indian languages (not just UI, but content too)
- Offline support (internet is expensive and unreliable)
- Mobile-first design (we use phones, not laptops)
- Indian education system integration (CBSE, JEE, NEET)
- Affordable data usage (we have limited data plans)

Thank you! 🙏
